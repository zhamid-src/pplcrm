# Sending guards & plan enforcement (anti-abuse layer)

Added 2026-07-14 to stop free-tier signups being used for spam. Two subsystems: **send guards**
(newsletter sending) and **plan gates** (FEATURE_MATRIX enforcement).

## Send guards — `apps/backend/src/app/modules/newsletters/send-guards.ts`

All constants (caps, rates, messages) live at the top of that file. Enforcement points:

1. **Pre-send** — `assertTenantMaySendNewsletter(db, tenantId, plannedRecipients)` in
   `NewslettersController.sendNewsletter`. Checks, in order:
   - `tenants.suspended_at` set → FORBIDDEN (suspended accounts also can't sign in — auth checks
     the same column).
   - `tenants.sending_paused_at` set → FORBIDDEN (tripwire pause).
   - No DKIM-verified sending domain → PRECONDITION_FAILED. "Verified" = the
     `communications.default_from_email` setting's domain appears in the
     `communications.verified_domains` setting with `status: 'verified'` (the Settings → Domains
     whitelabel flow writes that). Domain verification is available on EVERY plan including
     Free — it's what keeps free-tier mail out of spam, and it's deliberately NOT plan-gated.
     Credential resolution (`settings/controller.ts` `resolveWhitelabelCredentials`) mirrors the
     send path: a tenant-owned SendGrid key wins; otherwise the domain auth + link branding are
     created on the PLATFORM key at the parent level and associated (SendGrid
     `/whitelabel/{domains,links}/{id}/subuser`) with the subuser the tenant sends through (their
     whitelabel subuser, or `SENDGRID_FREE_TIER_SUBUSER` on Free). In platform-key mode a domain
     will not reach `status: 'verified'` until that association succeeds (retried on every verify
     click, tracked as `subuserAssociated` on the entry) — perfect DNS with a failed association
     would still send unsigned mail. What stays paid-only is unrelated to this: custom WEB
     domains (serving pages on the org's own domain instead of `*.pplforms.com`) — not
     implemented yet, and not part of the Domains settings flow.
   - Free plan and `tenants.sending_phone_verified_at` null → PRECONDITION_FAILED. Phone
     verification lives in `settings/controller.ts` (`requestPhoneVerification` /
     `confirmPhoneVerification`, Twilio SMS via `lib/sms`, code hash stored on the tenant row —
     deliberately NOT in settings, whose snapshot is client-readable). UI: Workspace →
     Communications → "Sending phone verification".
   - Free plan and tenant younger than 7 days → warm-up cap: ≤100 emails per rolling 24h
     (`warmupDailyCap`, summed from `newsletter_send_log`).
   - Monthly plan email allowance exceeded → TOO_MANY_REQUESTS with the exact numbers and reset
     date. The allowance is `monthlyEmailCap(plan, tenants.subscription_quantity)` =
     `emailsPerSubscriber` × the billed bracket's subscriber cap (2× Free, 8× Grassroots,
     12× Movement; enterprise uncapped), metered from `newsletter_send_log` over `sendWindow()` —
     the billing cycle stepped monthly back from `subscription_ends_at` (so annual still resets
     monthly), or the UTC calendar month for free tenants. This is the plan meter (added
     2026-07-18): sending N emails requires being billed like an N-sized audience, which closes
     the "buy the lowest bracket, import a huge list, blast, cancel" hole. It works because
     upward bracket syncs are invoiced prorated IMMEDIATELY on both intervals
     (`subscription-sync.ts` `always_invoice`), so `subscription_quantity` is always paid-for.
     The composer surfaces it (newsletters.sendQuota query → "Monthly allowance" row + warning
     on Review & send; shortfall disables "Send now" but not scheduling).
   - Paid plan and `subscription_status` in `past_due`/`unpaid` → PRECONDITION_FAILED payment
     hold (`hasPaymentHold`, checked inside `assertTenantSendingNotBlocked`, so it also blocks
     test sends and stops in-flight sends per batch in the worker). This is the enforcement
     backstop for the immediate proration invoice: a declined card holds sending until the
     payment method is fixed on Workspace → Billing. Free/enterprise never hold. The status is
     written by the `customer.subscription.updated` Stripe webhook; clears automatically when
     Stripe retries succeed (status back to `active`).
     1b. **Content gate (newsletter preflight)** — `newsletterPreflight.assertNewsletterContentSendable(db,
tenantId, newsletterRow)` (`modules/newsletters/preflight.service.ts`), called in
     `NewslettersController.sendNewsletter` directly after `assertTenantMaySendNewsletter`. A
     deliverability score 0–100 is assembled from explainable deductions: the shared deterministic
     lint (`libs/common/src/lib/preflight-lint.ts` — subject patterns, base64/oversize HTML,
     shortener/raw-IP/anchor-mismatch links, image-only bodies) plus a Claude content review
     (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`, `messages.parse` + `zodOutputFormat(AiPreflightVerdictObj)`, model
     `env.anthropicModel` default claude-opus-4-8). Bands live in
     `libs/common/src/lib/schemas/content-check.schema.ts`: `PREFLIGHT_GOOD = 80`,
     `PREFLIGHT_BLOCK = 50`; `score < 50` → PRECONDITION_FAILED ("Deliverability score N — fix the
     items flagged…") on every plan. Results cache in `newsletter_content_checks` keyed
     `(tenant_id, content_hash)` (sha256 over raw subject/html/plainText via `preflightHashInput`) —
     the composer's interactive `newsletters.runPreflight` (lint + Postmark spamcheck + AI, rate
     limited 30/h/tenant) usually pre-populates it, so the send-time gate is a cache hit.
     **Fail-open:** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` unset or the API erroring skips the AI layer (lint still
     scores); the Postmark spamcheck runs ONLY in the interactive check, never the send gate (keeps
     tests network-free). AI verdicts `scam_or_phishing` / `pure_commercial_marketing` (confidence
     ≥0.6) carry a 90-point deduction — blocked by construction. Fundraising/auctions/events are
     explicitly allowed in the prompt. **Every check includes the AI review** — the send gate and
     interactive checks alike, on every plan (deliberate 2026-07-17 decision, reversing a brief
     risk-scoped design: the pre-send threat the AI uniquely stops is a compromised established
     account blasting clean-linked phishing through shared sending infrastructure, and that risk
     grows with tenure and list size; per-check cost is cents and marketing states the always-on
     claim). `PreflightResult.aiStatus`: 'reviewed' | 'unavailable' (key unset/API error,
     fail-open) | 'not_required' (only the composer's local quick check). Composer UI: score
     gauge + findings card on Review & send, "Check deliverability" next to Send test email.
2. **Per batch, in the worker** — `handleSendNewsletter` (`lib/jobs/handlers/newsletter.handlers.ts`)
   re-loads the tenant every batch:
   - Paused/suspended mid-send → newsletter `status = 'paused'`, resume point saved in
     `newsletters.send_offset`, job ends. A later re-send resumes from `send_offset` instead of
     double-sending (`sendNewsletter` handles `status === 'paused'`).
   - `remainingSendAllowance` (hourly cap per plan + warm-up cap + monthly plan allowance)
     trims each batch; at 0 it enqueues a continuation job (+15 min) and frees the worker slot.
   - Every delivered batch inserts a `newsletter_send_log` row — that table IS the meter; it is
     pruned (30 days) inside the per-tenant loop of `pruneNewsletterEvents`.
3. **Tripwires, in the SendGrid webhook** — `applyEngagementTripwires` runs after each aggregate
   recompute (`newsletters-webhook.route.ts`). On sends ≥20 recipients: hard-bounce rate >5% →
   `pauseTenantSending`; spam-complaint rate >1% → `suspendTenant` (sets `suspended_at`, blocks
   sign-in, pending human review). Both log `[abuse-tripwire]` errors via Pino.
   **Automation sends are covered too (2026-07-19):** `applyAutomationTripwires` (same file as the
   newsletter one, same thresholds/min-sample via `evaluateTripwires`) runs from the webhook for
   every tenant whose automation events included a bounce/complaint. Because automation emails are
   one-recipient sends spread over time, the sample is a rolling 7-day window
   (`AUTOMATION_TRIPWIRE_WINDOW_DAYS`): delivered sends from `newsletter_send_log`
   (`source='automation'`) vs hard bounces / spam complaints the webhook stamps onto
   `workflow_runs.bounced_at` / `spam_reported_at` (migration `2026-07-20-f`; soft `blocked`
   bounces never stamp). Pause reason strings: `automation_hard_bounce_rate` /
   `automation_spam_complaint_rate`.

**To un-pause / un-suspend** (support action, no UI): clear `tenants.sending_paused_at` (+
`sending_paused_reason`) or `tenants.suspended_at` in the DB. A paused newsletter is then
re-sent from the UI and resumes at its `send_offset`.

**Website claims:** the 5% bounce / 1% complaint tripwires, the warm-up cap, the
verified-domain requirement and the enforced monthly allowance (2×/8×/12× multipliers on the
security page; "enforced at send time" in EULA §8) are quoted verbatim on the marketing site
(EULA §8, security page, FAQ). The preflight is also stated publicly: the "below 50 cannot send" threshold (security page,
EULA §8 bullet, help articles) and Anthropic in the privacy policy's subprocessor list + the
US-processing residency exception. If you change `PREFLIGHT_BLOCK`, the AI provider, or what the
AI receives, update those pages in the same change — see the `pplcrm-website-claims` skill for
the full registry.

**Reputation isolation:** free-tier sends on the platform SendGrid key default to the
`SENDGRID_FREE_TIER_SUBUSER` env subuser (tenant whitelabel subuser or tenant-owned API key wins).

**Postmark side:** transactional sends attach `Metadata.tenant_id`; the
`/api/postmark/webhook` route (`modules/mail/routes/postmark-webhook.route.ts`, auth =
`X-Postmark-Webhook-Token` header matching `POSTMARK_WEBHOOK_TOKEN`) writes hard bounces /
complaints into `email_suppressions`.

**Signup:** disposable-email domains are rejected in `auth/controller.ts signUp` via
`lib/mail/disposable-email-domains.ts` (curated Set — extend it, don't replace with a huge list).

**Automation emails obey the same layer (2026-07-18; tightened 2026-07-19):** the drip worker
(`handleProcessDripWorkflows`) first applies the **plan gate at processing time** — a tenant whose
plan lacks the `automations` feature (below Grassroots; `planAllowsFeature`) has its due
enrollments deferred an hour (nothing sends, nothing advances, nothing deleted — behaves like
paused, logged once per tenant per tick as `[plan-gate]`), so a downgrade actually stops running
automations. The workflow `send_email` step then checks the step's engagement condition
(`config.send_condition`, evaluated against the previous email run's `opened_at`/`clicked_at` —
unmet → `skipped` run), consent via `modules/workflows/automation-consent.ts` (suppressed / DNC /
unsubscribed-from-all-campaigns → run recorded as `skipped`, not failed), checks
`assertTenantSendingNotBlocked` (blocked → enrollment deferred 1h, not advanced), the identity
gates — `hasVerifiedSendingDomain` and, on Free, phone verification (`needsPhoneVerification` →
`AUTOMATION_PHONE_UNVERIFIED_MESSAGE`); either missing → failed run with the fix named — and the
allowance: `remainingSendAllowance` minus the tenant's enqueued-but-unsent `send-automation-email`
jobs (in-flight accounting). **Quota is metered on actual delivery, not enqueue:** the delivery
handler (`automation-mail.handlers.ts`) writes the `newsletter_send_log` row
(`source='automation'`, `newsletter_id NULL`) after SendGrid accepts the send, gated by the job
payload's `meterOnSend` flag (legacy flagless jobs were metered at enqueue; a job that exhausts
its retries consumes nothing). `sentEmailsSince` (and therefore the warm-up/hourly/monthly caps)
includes automation volume automatically. Send-log retention is 32 days
(`SEND_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS`, newsletter.handlers.ts) so the meter outlives a 31-day billing cycle. **Delivery is SendGrid, not Postmark** (Postmark = pplCRM-to-user mail only): the
step inserts its `workflow_runs` row first, then enqueues `send-automation-email`
(`lib/jobs/handlers/automation-mail.handlers.ts`) which resolves the tenant's sending identity
(same settings keys + free-tier subuser as newsletters) and sends with
`custom_args.workflow_run_id`; the SendGrid event webhook
(`modules/newsletters/routes/newsletters-webhook.route.ts` → `applyAutomationEvent`) stamps
`opened_at`/`clicked_at` back onto the run (click also stamps open — MPP makes opens noisy) and
writes bounce/complaint suppressions. Workflow-level `exit_conditions` (jsonb string[] —
donated / opened_any_email / clicked_any_email) end an enrollment early (`status='exited'`,
run row `step_kind='exit'`). Automation emails carry a per-recipient HMAC unsubscribe link
(`modules/newsletters/unsubscribe-token.ts` → public `GET /api/unsubscribe/:token`, which flips
all the person's `campaign_subscriptions` to unsubscribed) in a server-appended footer
(`buildAutomationFooter`; SendGrid subscription tracking disabled for these sends).

**Scheduled newsletters:** `process_scheduled_newsletters` (5-min cron,
`lib/jobs/handlers/newsletter.handlers.ts`) fires `status='scheduled'` rows through
`sendNewsletter`, so guards + preflight run at fire time; failures revert to draft + notify.
Scheduling itself flows through generic CRUD add/update, so `NewslettersController.add/update`
validate server-side (`assertSchedulable`): setting `status='scheduled'` requires a non-null,
future `send_date` (BAD_REQUEST otherwise) — a NULL date would never match the cron's
`send_date <= now` and sit invisible forever. Updates that merely edit other fields of an
already-scheduled row are exempt from the future check (a just-arrived send time is about to fire).
(Recurring newsletters were removed entirely 2026-07-18 — first the auto-send mode, then the
whole feature: draft-per-cadence added little over "Schedule for later". Migration
`2026-07-20-d` drops `newsletter_schedules` and `newsletters.schedule_id`.)

**Resend to non-openers:** `newsletters.resendToNonOpeners` clones a sent newsletter
(`resend_of_id` link, partial unique index = one resend per original, new subject required and
must differ) and sends through the normal guarded path; `buildRecipientQuery` excludes anyone
with an open/click event on the original at send time. Apple MPP asymmetry: machine-opens make
Apple users look like openers, so the resend under-reaches rather than over-reaches.

## Plan gates — `apps/backend/src/app/modules/billing/plan-gate.ts`

`GATED_FEATURES` in `libs/common/src/lib/billing/plans.ts` is the machine-readable core of
FEATURE_MATRIX (keep both in sync): forms/donations/automations/lists/volunteers (staff-side
management: teams, volunteer-events) → `grassroots`+; canvassing/deliveries/companions
(companion-access) → `movement`+. `planFeatureGate(feature)` is a tRPC
middleware that blocks **mutations only** (reads stay open — disclosure over suppression);
gated routers rebind locally:

```ts
import { authProcedure as baseAuthProcedure, router } from '../../../trpc';
import { planFeatureGate } from '../billing/plan-gate';
const authProcedure = baseAuthProcedure.use(planFeatureGate('forms'));
```

`createCrudRouter` accepts the gated procedure as its 4th argument. Gated routers today:
web-forms, donations, workflows, lists, canvassing, deliveries, companion-access, teams,
volunteer-events. Unknown/missing plan values fail closed to `free`.

## Test traps

- Router specs that mock `BaseRepository.dbInstance` with one shared `executeTakeFirst` row must
  include `subscription_plan: 'movement'` in that row, or every mutation dies on the plan gate.
- DB-backed newsletter send tests must seed the tenant on a paid plan **and** the two settings
  rows (`communications.default_from_email` + a `verified` entry in
  `communications.verified_domains`) — see `createTestSeed` in `newsletters/controller.spec.ts`.
- Pure threshold/cap logic (`warmupDailyCap`, `evaluateTripwires`, `planKeyOf`) is unit-tested in
  `send-guards.spec.ts` — extend there, no DB needed.

## Env vars

`SENDGRID_FREE_TIER_SUBUSER` (free-pool subuser), `POSTMARK_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` (webhook auth), plus
the pre-existing `TWILIO_*` (SMS codes; dev-mocks when unset).

`ALLOW_MOCK_DOMAIN_VERIFICATION=true` — local-dev-only opt-in that lets Settings → Domains
auto-pass DNS verification when no valid SendGrid key (tenant-owned or platform
`SENDGRID_API_KEY`) is configured (set in `.env.test` for the
backend suite). Without it, domain verification fails closed: a missing/broken SendGrid key or a
SendGrid API outage leaves records unverified rather than silently opening the sending guards
(`settings/controller.ts` `verifyVerifiedDomain`, `sendgrid-whitelabel.service.ts` validate
fallbacks). Note domain `status: 'verified'` requires SPF + both DKIM records + link branding;
DMARC is recommended but optional and never blocks verification.
