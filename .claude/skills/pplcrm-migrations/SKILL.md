# pplCRM Database Migrations

Migrations are plain Kysely SQL files run by Kysely's `Migrator` + `FileMigrationProvider`. There is **no codegen and no separate `migrate` npm script** — migrations run automatically when the backend boots.

## The non-obvious rules first

1. **The baseline file is `schema.sql`, NOT `schema_dump.sql`.** The real file is `apps/backend/src/app/_migrations/schema.sql`, read by `0001_baseline.ts`. Stale `schema_dump.sql` mentions survive in `apps/backend/STRUCTURE.md` and the repomix ignore-globs (root `package.json` / `apps/backend/project.json`) — trust the code, not those.

2. **Never edit or rename a migration that has already run.** Kysely records each applied migration by name in the `kysely_migration` table. An already-recorded migration is never re-run, so editing its `up()` silently changes nothing on any DB that already ran it. Renaming or deleting one is worse: Kysely finds a recorded name with no matching file and aborts with a **corrupt migrations** error. Proof this bites in practice: `ensureMigrationTableUpdated` in `kyselyinit.ts` exists solely to `UPDATE kysely_migration SET name = ...` after some migrations were renamed. Don't create that mess — add a new file instead. (The one sanctioned exception is a deliberate pre-ship **re-squash**, which deletes the dated files _and_ resets `kysely_migration` in the same operation — see "Re-squashing" below.)

3. **`tools/ai-migrations/` is unrelated.** It contains only Nx package-upgrade notes and is referenced nowhere in the codebase. It is NOT a migration tool. Ignore it.

## Naming convention

Files live in `apps/backend/src/app/_migrations/`. Kysely runs them in **lexicographic filename order**, so the name is load-bearing:

- Regular migrations: `YYYY-MM-DD-short-description.ts` — e.g. `2026-08-14-add-campaign-budget.ts`. (After the 2026-07-10 re-squash there are no dated files in the tree to crib from — for a worked add-column + backfill + per-tenant-unique-index example see `2026-07-07-record-slugs.ts` in git history.)
- The baseline is `0001_baseline.ts` — the `0001_` numeric prefix sorts before every dated file so it always runs first.
- **Same-day tie-break:** when two migrations share a date, disambiguate order with a letter segment: `2026-07-01-a-schema-improvements`, `2026-07-01-b-security-ops-improvements`. Use this if you add a second migration on a day that already has one.

Every file must export `up(db: Kysely<any>)` and `down(db: Kysely<any>)`.

## How migrations run

- Registered via `BaseRepository.migrator` — `Migrator` + `FileMigrationProvider` pointed at `apps/backend/src/app/_migrations`, resolved from `process.cwd()` (`apps/backend/src/app/lib/base.repo.ts`).
- **Dev:** applied automatically on backend startup — `apps/backend/src/main.ts` calls `migrateToLatest()` from `kyselyinit.ts` when `MIGRATE_ON_BOOT` is true (the default). Starting the backend brings the DB to latest.
- **Prod:** `MIGRATE_ON_BOOT=false` — startup does NOT migrate. The `migrate` job in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs `kyselyinit.ts` (as the owner role, via the `PROD_DB_*` secrets) before the backend rolls to the new image; a migration failure blocks the deploy. Added after the 2026-07-23 outage, where code reading `authusers.campaign_id` deployed without its migration and every authenticated request 500'd while health probes stayed green. Manual fallback command: `deploy/GO-LIVE-CHECKLIST.md` §9.
- State is tracked in the Kysely-managed tables `kysely_migration` and `kysely_migration_lock`. Never write to these by hand except through the existing rename shim.

### Data backfills on FORCE-RLS tables just work — but always test a fresh bootstrap

Most domain tables run `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` (the S-1 tenant backstop; grep `schema.sql` for it — persons, households, companies, tasks, and the `map_*` junctions all do). A migration runs with **no `app.tenant_id` GUC set**, but every `tenant_isolation` policy has the escape `NULLIF(current_setting('app.tenant_id', true), '') IS NULL OR …` in both `USING` and `WITH CHECK`, so an unset GUC makes the policy permit **every** row. A migration's `UPDATE`/`DELETE`/backfill therefore reaches all rows — **no per-migration RLS toggle is needed**, and you should not add one.

This only works because `0001_baseline.ts` **strips `SET row_security = off`** out of the pg*dump preamble (same line-filter that strips `search_path`). That dump setting would otherwise leak forward through Kysely's single-session `migrateToLatest()` run, and `row_security = off` + FORCE RLS makes Postgres **reject** even policy-permitted writes with `SQLSTATE 42501` / *"query would be affected by row-level security policy"\_ — rolling back the whole batch including the baseline, so no fresh DB (CI, new dev) can bootstrap. If you ever see that 42501 in a migration, the cause is a stray `row_security = off` in session scope, **not** a reason to disable FORCE RLS.

Always verify a new migration by running the whole batch against a **freshly provisioned** DB (`TEST_DB_NAME=pplcrm_x_test apps/backend/scripts/setup-test-db.sh`, then `migrateToLatest`) — an already-migrated `pplcrm_test` won't re-run your migration or a bootstrap. Pure DDL (`ADD COLUMN`, `CREATE INDEX`, `ADD CONSTRAINT`) is unaffected either way.

## Worked example — add a table

A dated migration is a small raw-SQL file. Model yours on this shape (real ones carry more columns/indexes and a `tenant_id` for multi-tenant scoping):

```ts
import type { Kysely } from 'kysely';
import { sql } from 'kysely';

export async function up(db: Kysely<any>): Promise<void> {
  await sql`
    CREATE TABLE public.person_newsletter_engagements (
      tenant_id     bigint  NOT NULL,
      newsletter_id bigint  NOT NULL,
      email         text    NOT NULL,
      PRIMARY KEY (tenant_id, newsletter_id, email)
    )
  `.execute(db);
  await sql`CREATE INDEX idx_pne_tenant_email ON public.person_newsletter_engagements (tenant_id, email)`.execute(db);
}

export async function down(db: Kysely<any>): Promise<void> {
  await sql`DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.person_newsletter_engagements`.execute(db);
}
```

For column additions, use idempotent `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` / `DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS`. Note tables carry a `tenant_id` for multi-tenant scoping (see `pplcrm-tenant-safety`).

## After the migration: update the Kysely types by hand

There is **no `kysely-codegen`**. The `Models` interface is maintained manually in `libs/common/src/lib/kysely.models.ts`; its header comment states the rule: "When adding a new table … Add a model and add it to the interface Models." So a migration that adds/changes a table is not finished until you add/edit the corresponding model interface and register it in the `Models` map. Without this, Kysely queries against the new table won't type-check.

## The schema baseline (`schema.sql`)

`0001_baseline.ts` bootstraps a database by executing `schema.sql` (a `pg_dump --schema-only`). It does not re-run on a database that already recorded it.

**As of the 2026-07-10 re-squash, the baseline IS the current, complete schema and there are no dated migrations.** The 2026-07-07 squash collapsed the ~34 dated remediation migrations; on 2026-07-10 the 17 dated files that had accumulated since (record slugs → authusers-deactivated-at, plus `tenants.demo_mode_at`) were folded in the same way — fresh `pg_dump` taken with the PG18 client (`/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@18/bin/pg_dump`; the PATH default is a 17.6 client that refuses an 18 server), dated files deleted, dev and test DBs dropped and re-bootstrapped (see "Re-squashing"). So on a fresh DB Kysely runs `0001_baseline` and nothing else, and — unlike before — `schema.sql` **does** reflect the current shape. (`libs/common/src/lib/kysely.models.ts` and a live `psql \d` are still the authoritative Kysely-side view.)

### Fresh-database prerequisites — provisioning, run BEFORE the app first boots

The baseline assumes the S-2 least-privilege role split already exists. A brand-new database must be provisioned first or `0001_baseline` fails with one of these (both verified 2026-07-07):

- **`permission denied to create extension "pg_trgm"`** — the database is not owned by `pplcrm_owner`. Trusted extensions (`pg_trgm`, `pgcrypto`) need CREATE on the database, which the owner has.
- **`must be owner of schema public`** — schema `public` is not owned by `pplcrm_owner`, so the baseline's own `ALTER SCHEMA public OWNER TO pplcrm_owner` can't run.

Both are fixed by running `apps/backend/scripts/setup-db-roles.sql` **once as a superuser** (or the DB's current owner) before migrating — it creates the `pplcrm_owner`/`pplcrm_app` roles, transfers database + `public`-schema ownership to `pplcrm_owner`, and applies the grants. `setup.sh` runs it for a new dev machine. On Render (no superuser) create the two roles and transfer ownership via the primary role before the first deploy. The `0001_baseline` loader does **not** strip the `OWNER TO` / `ALTER SCHEMA` / `GRANT` lines — they rely on this provisioning being correct.

### Going forward — the normal flow resumes

New schema changes are new dated `YYYY-MM-DD-*.ts` files on top of the baseline, exactly as before. **Do NOT regenerate `schema.sql` for an ordinary change** — add a migration file. `schema.sql` is only re-dumped during a deliberate re-squash.

### Re-squashing (optional, pre-ship only)

When the dated-migration list grows unwieldy and there is no production data to preserve, collapse again:

1. `pg_dump --schema-only` a fully-migrated DB → overwrite `schema.sql` (schema only, no `COPY`/`INSERT`).
2. Delete the dated `*.ts` files (keep `0001_baseline.ts`).
3. Reset tracking so Kysely doesn't abort on the missing files: `DELETE FROM kysely_migration WHERE name <> '0001_baseline'` on **every** existing DB (dev _and_ test), or drop/recreate them.
4. **Verify a from-scratch build** — provision a throwaway DB with `setup-db-roles.sql`, boot the backend against it, and confirm `migration up:"0001_baseline" successful`. This is the step that catches the ownership/version gaps above; don't skip it.

Note the loader strips at run time: psql `\` meta-commands (`\restrict`/`\unrestrict`), the `search_path` `set_config` line, the PG17-only `transaction_timeout` SET, and any `kysely_migration`/`kysely_migration_lock` DDL — so a dump taken with a newer `pg_dump` client against an older server still loads.

## Non-goals

- **Kysely query/repository patterns, `Insertable`/`Updateable`, transactions, transactional outbox** → `pplcrm-trpc-backend`.
- **Zod schema triad (`AddXObj`/`UpdateXObj`/`XObj`)** that usually accompanies a new table → `pplcrm-schemas-validation`.
- **The full "add a new entity end-to-end" chain** (schema → migration → types → router → frontend) → `pplcrm-add-entity`; this skill owns only the migration + baseline step.
- **`tenant_id` scoping and the `no-unscoped-db-query` rule** → `pplcrm-tenant-safety`.
