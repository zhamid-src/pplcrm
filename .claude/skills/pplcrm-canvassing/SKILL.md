description: How PeopleCRM's Canvassing feature (§13) works end-to-end — the turfs/turf_households/turf_assignments/turf_knocks tables, the turf-cutting engine (clusters geocoded households into contiguous ward-bounded turfs), derived progress from knocks, the tokenised account-less Canvass Companion, and the field report. USE WHEN editing anything under modules/canvassing, experiences/canvassing, the turf/knock schema, the cutting engine, the Companion public route, or the field report.

# Canvassing (§13)

Cut a smart-list universe into walkable **turfs**, hand them to volunteers via a
**Canvass Companion** (web app, no account), and let every knock sync back live.
Built net-new in Wave 2 Track F. Reuses Wave 1A geocoding (`households.lat/lng` +
`ward`) and Wave 1C `lists.getCurrentMembers` — do **not** re-derive either.

## Data model (migration `_migrations/2026-07-11-canvassing.ts`)

Four tables, canvassing-namespaced (so they never collide with Track G's
delivery tables). All follow the house pattern: `bigint` id + `UNIQUE(id)` +
`PRIMARY KEY(id, tenant_id)`, `ENABLE`+`FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` with the
standard `tenant_isolation` policy, grants to `pplcrm_app`. Multi-statement DDL
runs through `sql.raw(...)` (parameterless → simple protocol), like the baseline.

| Table              | What it is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `turfs`            | A turf. `status` = `draft`\|`active`\|`retired` (stored lifecycle only). `list_id`, `target_doors`, `centroid_lat/lng`, `ward`.                                                                                                                                         |
| `turf_households`  | The doors — one row per household (junction, PK includes both).                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `turf_assignments` | A turf handed to a volunteer: `volunteer_person_id` (the person the link belongs to — required by the access layer), optional `expires_at`, `team_id`, `token`. `status` = `active`\|`revoked`.                                                                         |
| `turf_knocks`      | **The source of truth for progress.** One row per door interaction. `outcome`, `response`, `issues[]`, follow-up flags (`wants_volunteer`/`wants_yard_sign`/`set_dnc`/`subscribe`), `contact_phone/email`, `source`, `canvasser_name`, `client_knock_id`, `knocked_at`. |

The migration is dated **2026-07-11** deliberately: Kysely aborts with "corrupted
migrations" if a new file sorts alphabetically _before_ an already-applied one, and
the dev DB has applied `2026-07-10-person-public-id` and
`2026-07-11-automations-step-kinds` ("automations" < "canvassing", so we still
sort last). If you add another canvassing migration, keep it dated ≥ the newest
applied file.

`turf_households.walk_order` stores the suggested visit order (set at cut time
from the engine's snake sweep — a hint, never a lock). `campaigns` carries the
Companion survey vocabulary: `canvass_issues text[]` + `canvass_script`.

Kysely models live in `libs/common/src/lib/kysely.models.ts` (Turfs,
TurfHouseholds, TurfAssignments, TurfKnocks). Zod triad + vocabularies in
`libs/common/src/lib/schemas/canvassing.schema.ts` (`TURF_STATUSES`,
`KNOCK_OUTCOMES` — now incl. `moved` + the append-only `cleared` marker — and
`KNOCK_RESPONSES`, the spec-§3.5 five: `supporter | undecided | non_supporter |
not_voting | already_voted`, labels in `KNOCK_RESPONSE_LABELS`). The Companion
API contract (`CompanionTurfPayload`, `CompanionOpObj` union, `CompanionOpAck`)
lives in the same schema file and is shared with `apps/companion`.

### Derived state — never stored twice (§22.6)

Progress ("attempted", "conversations", "In field now", "Complete") is **derived
from `turf_knocks` at read time** — there are no counter columns. `turfs.status`
stores only the true lifecycle (`draft`/`active`/`retired`); the display status
(`draft`|`assigned`|`in_field`|`complete`|`retired`) is computed in
`CanvassingController.displayStatus` from stored status + knock activity + door
count. `attempted` = `COUNT(DISTINCT household_id)`; `in_field` = a knock within
`IN_FIELD_WINDOW_MS` (6h).

## The cutting engine (`modules/canvassing/lib/cutting-engine.ts`)

Pure, dependency-free, unit-tested (`cutting-engine.spec.ts`). `cutTurfs(doors,
target)` and `previewCut(...)` share the same code so the dialog preview can
never disagree with the actual cut.

- **Input**: geocoded households (`{household_id, lat, lng, ward}`). Ungeocoded
  ones are reported as `unplaced`, never dropped.
- **Barriers**: the only barrier data shipped is the ward/precinct GIS polygons
  (`lib/gis/boundaries.geojson`), whose edges follow real rivers/rail/arterials.
  So the engine treats the **ward boundary as the barrier — a turf never spans
  two wards**. True per-street barrier linework isn't in the dataset, so finer
  avoidance is deferred to the manual "rebalance on the map" step the spec
  already calls for. If you add real barrier data, this is where it plugs in.
- **Contiguity**: within a ward, doors are ordered along a latitude-banded
  boustrophedon ("snake") sweep, then chunked into near-equal runs → compact,
  contiguous turfs without a TSP solve.

## The universe = a smart list (reuse, don't re-derive)

`CanvassingController.resolveUniverseHouseholdIds` calls
`new ListsController().getCurrentMembers(auth, listId)` (Wave 1C). If the list is
`people`, it maps to distinct `household_id`s; if `households`, uses them
directly. Then `TurfsRepo.getHouseholdsGeo` fetches lat/lng/ward. **Refresh from
list** re-runs this, drops doors that left the list (knock rows persist —
history kept) and adds new in-ward members not yet in any turf.

## Canvass Companion — tokenised, verified, in apps/companion (§13.4 + COMPANION-APPS-PLAN.md)

Public REST route `modules/canvassing/routes/canvass-public.route.ts`, mounted at
`/api/canvass` in `routes.ts`. The volunteer UI is the separate mobile app
`apps/companion` at `/t/:token` (route in `apps/companion/src/app/app.routes.ts`;
components under `apps/companion/src/app/canvass/`); there is no companion page in
`apps/frontend` anymore.

**Security model — two credentials** (see `pplcrm-companion-access`): the
`turf_assignments.token` (24 random bytes, base64url, UNIQUE) scopes WHAT — it is
resolved by `TurfAssignmentsRepo.resolveByToken`, the one intentionally
un-tenant-scoped query in the module, and everything downstream is scoped by the
resolved `tenant_id` + `turf_id`. The `X-Companion-Session` header proves WHO —
`getCompanionTurf`/`postCompanionResults` call
`CompanionAccessController.requireSession(...)` against the assignment's
`volunteer_person_id` (verified device + admin-approved volunteer). Expired
(`expires_at`) or revoked assignments read as a uniform dead link.

- **API**: `GET /api/canvass/t/:token` → `CompanionTurfPayload` (campaign name,
  script + issue vocabulary, canvasser identity, walk-ordered households with
  residents, DNC flags, door outcomes, survey pre-fills — payload-minimized: no
  emails/phones/notes ever). `POST /api/canvass/t/:token/results` → batched ops
  (`survey`, `person_result`, `door_outcome`, `clear_outcome`, `person_create`),
  each claimed in the `companion_ops` ledger (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`) and applied
  in its own transaction; acks are `applied | duplicate | rejected` per op, and a
  `person_create` ack returns the real id to swap for the client temp id. The
  legacy `POST /knock` single-op endpoint remains for compatibility.
- **Survey side-effects** (all inside the op's transaction,
  `controller.applySurveySideEffects`): support/turnout →
  `campaign_person_facts` (supporter→strong, non_supporter→against,
  not_voting/already_voted→voting_status); `wants_yard_sign` → a `source='canvass'`
  `delivery_requests` row unless the household already has an open one;
  `set_dnc` → `persons.do_not_contact`; contact capture fills blanks only;
  `subscribe` → `campaign_subscriptions` with `consent_source='canvass'`;
  `wants_volunteer` → sets `persons.volunteer_status = 'prospective'` when it is
  NULL (first-class status, §15 — not a tag; + 'Added at door' tag on person_create).
- **Offline**: the app queues ops in `localStorage` (`pc-canvass-queue:<token>`),
  replays them as an optimistic overlay (`canvass-derive.ts applyLocalOps`), and
  flushes on the `online` event / load — idempotent via `op_id`.
- **Honest attribution (§22.7)**: activity rows land under the **real CRM account
  that deployed the link** (`assignment.created_by`) with `metadata.via =
"via Canvass Companion (<volunteer name>)"` — the name now comes from the
  assignment's volunteer person server-side, never from client input.

## Frontend

- `experiences/canvassing/services/canvassing-service.ts` — extends `TRPCService`,
  wraps `api.canvassing.*`. Router: `modules/canvassing/trpc.router.ts`, registered
  as `canvassing:` in `modules/trpc.ts`.
- `ui/canvassing-page.ts` — the /canvassing page (Turfs & assignments + Field
  report tabs, `pc-map` turf-centroid markers tinted by status). The Field report
  tab's **Coverage** card (§13.3) has a Street map / By ward toggle: `getCoverage`
  (router + `controller.getCoverage`) returns one door per geocoded turf household
  coloured by window knock status (`conversation`/`attempted`/`not_yet`), a
  convex-hull dashed boundary per turf, and a by-ward roll-up. It renders whenever
  turfs have geocoded doors — independently of `report.doors` — so a freshly-cut
  universe reads as an all-grey map before the first knock. Aggregation lives in
  `controller.getCoverage` (+ the module-level `convexHull`); the raw per-door rows
  come from `TurfHouseholdsRepo.getCoverageRows` (`CoverageDoorRow`).
- `ui/cut-turfs-dialog.ts` — universe select (reuses `ListsService.getAllWithCounts`),
  presets, live preview.
- `ui/assign-turf-dialog.ts` — assignment is personal: pick the volunteer person
  (search by name; they need an email/mobile on file for verification), mint the
  token, copy `/t/:token`. `AssignTurfObj` requires `volunteer_person_id`.
- `ui/companion-settings-dialog.ts` — "Survey settings" (header button): the
  campaign-scoped issue chips + door script every Companion shows
  (`canvassing.getCompanionSettings`/`updateCompanionSettings`, admin-gated write).
- Sidebar entry: `layout/sidebar/sidebar-items.ts` under FIELD (icon `map-pin`,
  shortcut `v`). Help article: `experiences/help/data/articles/engagement.ts`
  (`id: 'canvassing'`); `/canvassing` is in the help spec's route allow-list.

## Testing / gotchas

- Backend specs share one Postgres instance across worktrees. Parallel tracks
  apply their own migrations to `pplcrm_test`, which makes Kysely abort with
  "corrupted migrations". Use a **dedicated** test DB:
  `TEST_DB_NAME=pplcrm_canvass_test apps/backend/scripts/setup-test-db.sh` and set
  `DB_NAME=pplcrm_canvass_test` in `.env.test`. globalSetup then builds it from
  scratch (also the fresh-DB migration verification).
- `controller.spec.ts` seeds a static household list of geocoded doors across two
  wards and drives the full flow (cut → assign → token → idempotent knock →
  progress → refresh). `cutting-engine.spec.ts` covers clustering purely.
- Mixed `.select([...])` (string cols + `sql` builders) type-checks as a plain
  array but **not** in a `.select(() => [...])` callback — use plain arrays.

## What's deferred (and why)

- **Filled turf polygons on the _turf strip_** (Turfs & assignments tab) — the
  turf list row only carries the centroid, so that map still pins tinted centroids
  honestly. The **Coverage** map (Field report tab) _does_ draw per-turf boundaries,
  computing the convex hull of each turf's door coordinates on the fly in
  `getCoverage` — reuse that if you want hulls on the turf strip too.
- **Sub-ward barrier avoidance** — no highway/rail/water linework in the shipped
  GIS data; ward boundary is the honest proxy (see engine).
- **Team-target picker UI** — the backend fully supports `team_id`; the page
  currently issues the tokenised-link assignment ("Copy a link instead" path).

## Campaigns (§15) — turfs belong to a context

- `turfs.campaign_id` (NOT NULL): turfs are cut FOR a campaign; `cutTurfs`/`addTurf` resolve the
  explicit `campaign_id` input or fall back to the tenant's office context.
- **Knock outcomes with a stance upsert `campaign_person_facts.support_level` for the TURF's
  campaign** (`source='canvass'`; mapping strong_support→strong, lean_support→leaning,
  undecided→undecided, opposed→against) — see `KNOCK_RESPONSE_TO_SUPPORT` in the controller.
  A writ-period knock updates the election campaign's read on the voter, never the office's.
  See `pplcrm-campaigns` for the full contexts model.
