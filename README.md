## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

- Node.js 18+
- Yarn or npm
- PostgreSQL (local or Docker)
- A working SMTP provider for email features

This will help you set up your environment if it's your first time:

## 🛠️ Local Setup Instructions (For First-Time Users)

Follow these steps if you're setting up your development environment from scratch on macOS:

---

### 🔧 Prerequisites (Quick Setup)

To install all required dependencies, initialize Nx, and set up PostgreSQL automatically, run the following script from your project root:

1. Make the script executable:
   chmod +x setup.sh

2. Run it:

./setup.sh

> ⚠️ This script is designed for macOS and assumes a local PostgreSQL setup. It will:
>
> - Install Homebrew (if missing)
> - Install Git, wget, nvm, Node.js, Angular CLI, Nx CLI
> - Install and start PostgreSQL
> - Create a Postgres role (`pplcrm`) and database (`pplcrm`)
> - Install npm dependencies

#### Hint regarding Postgresql

To start the server

```bash
brew services start postgresql
```

To stop the server later:

```bash
brew services stop postgresql
```

---

### 2. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pplcrm-org/pplcrm.git
cd pplcrm
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root or inside `apps/backend/`:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/pplcrm
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=username@example.com
SMTP_PASS=password
```

## 🐘 PostgreSQL Setup

### Option A: Local PostgreSQL

1. Start PostgreSQL (e.g. via Homebrew or native installer)
2. Create the database:

```bash
psql -U postgres
CREATE DATABASE pplcrm;
3. Ensure .env contains the correct DATABASE_URL.
```

### Option B: Dockerized PostgreSQL

```bash
docker run --name pplcrm-db \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=pplcrm \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -d postgres
```

## 🔧 Database Migrations

If you add Kysely or Drizzle-based migrations:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

## 🚀 Running the App

```bash
nx serve backend
```

### Backend (Angular)

nx lint frontend

npx prettier --write .
```

## 🌟 Features

nx build frontend
nx build backend

# Run affected tasks
nx affected:test
nx affected:lint
nx affected:build
```

## pplcrm Backend Architecture

The backend for `pplcrm` is a modular, type-safe system built using **Fastify**, **tRPC**, **Kysely**, and **PostgreSQL**. It is part of an **Nx monorepo**, and built with **esbuild** for performance.

### 📁 Directory Structure

- **apps/backend/**
  - **src/**
    - **app/**
      - **auth/** — JWT signing and validation logic
      - **controllers/** — tRPC route handlers
      - **repositories/** — Kysely-based data access layer
      - **services/** — Business logic like auth, email, sessions
      - **utils/** — Reusable helpers
    - **main.ts** — Fastify + tRPC initialization
  - **index.ts** — Entry point

---

### 🧱 Architectural Layers

#### 1. Controller Layer (tRPC)

- Located in `app/controllers/`
- Each controller corresponds to a database table (e.g. Tags, Users)
- Controllers inherit from a generic `BaseController`
- Handles business input validation and calls services or repositories

#### 2. Repository Layer (Kysely)

- Located in `app/repositories/`
- Each table has a corresponding repository (e.g. `TagsRepo`)
- Extends a generic `BaseRepository<T>` with CRUD operations
- All type-safe via `Models` interface from `kysely.models.ts`

#### 3. Service Layer

- Located in `app/services/`
- Encapsulates business logic (auth, profile merging, etc.)
- Services call one or more repositories
- Also responsible for sending emails or managing sessions

#### 4. Auth Layer

- Located in `app/auth/`
- Uses `fast-jwt` to sign/verify access and refresh tokens
- Used by the AuthService and also injected into tRPC context

### ⚙️ Tooling

| Tool          | Purpose                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------- |
| Fastify       | Web framework             |
| tRPC          | Type-safe backend router  |
| Kysely        | SQL builder (typed)       |
| PostgreSQL    | Relational database       |
| esbuild       | Fast bundler              |
| fast-jwt      | JWT library               |
| bcrypt        | Password hashing          |
| zod (planned) | Runtime schema validation |
| Nx            | Monorepo tooling          |

---

### 🔐 Authentication

- Passwords are hashed using `bcrypt`
- Tokens (access and refresh) are signed with `fast-jwt`
- Tokens can be stored in cookies or local storage
- On each request, tRPC context parses JWT and makes `userId` available

---

### ✅ Example Flow: Update a Row

1. Frontend calls `tags.update({ id, name })`
2. `TagsController.update()` is invoked
3. It calls `TagsRepo.update(id, payload)`
4. The row is updated using Kysely
5. Controller returns updated row or error

---

### 🧪 Testing & Dev

- Currently no testing framework set up (suggested: `vitest`)
- Local `.env` file holds credentials like DB connection and JWT secrets
- Strongly recommend using `zod` to validate config

---

### 🚀 Running Locally

pnpm install  
pnpm start backend

You can also run just the backend app directly from Nx using:

nx serve backend

---

### 📦 Deployment

- Built into `dist/apps/backend`
- Can be deployed via Docker, PM2, or systemd
- You can serve it behind a reverse proxy like Nginx or Caddy

## People CRM – Frontend

This is the frontend for **People CRM**, a modern Angular 20 application using standalone components and signals. It is structured to support scalability, maintainability, and modularity in a campaign-focused CRM tool.

---

### 🏗️ Architecture

#### Framework & Tools

- **Angular 20** (Standalone APIs, Signals, Zone-less mode)
- **Nx Monorepo** for project structure and tooling
- **Tailwind CSS** + **DaisyUI** for styling
- **AG Grid** for powerful table/data grid capabilities
- **tRPC** for type-safe API calls between frontend and backend
- **RxJS** (limited use in some services)

- **Tailwind + DaisyUI** for modern styling
- **Reusable `DataGrid`** component with undo/redo, delete, view, edit support
- **Signals + `effect()`** for reactive programming
- **Modular Feature Pages** per resource/entity (tags, users, etc.)

---

### 🔐 Backend Authentication

- Stored in local/session storage
- API token is managed via tRPC headers
- Auth logic is handled in `auth.service.ts` and `session.service.ts`

---

### 📦 API Integration

- Handled using `@trpc/client`
- Strongly typed backend calls
- Services in `data/` directory wrap API calls and share state via signals

---

### 📁 Notes

- AG Grid customization lives in `components/datagrid/`
- Alerts, modals, tags are in `uxcommon/`
- Shared logic is extracted to `abstract.service.ts`, `base-datagrid.ts`, etc.
