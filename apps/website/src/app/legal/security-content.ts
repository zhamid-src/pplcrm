Every newsletter also passes a deliverability check before it sends — a 0–100 score over content best practices plus an AI review that catches phishing-shaped and scam-like content; drafts scoring below 50 cannot send until fixed. The AI review runs on every send, on every plan — it exists to stop a compromised account from blasting phishing before a single message leaves, not just to police new signups. Each plan’s monthly email allowance (2× your subscriber cap on Free, 8× on Grassroots, 12× on Movement) is enforced in the send path, and emails sent by automations count toward the same allowance — send volume is tied to the audience size a workspace actually pays for, so a small plan cannot be used to blast a huge imported list. Sending pauses automatically when hard bounces exceed 5% and is suspended when spam complaints exceed 1%. Suppression is enforced in the send path itself, for newsletters and automation emails alike: unsubscribed, bounced and do-not-contact addresses are excluded from every future send, and nobody in your workspace can override that.',

When something fails, errors shown to users carry a support code that lets us find the exact server-side event without you sending us your data. Our servers are also monitored around the clock: automated probes check the service from outside every few minutes and page us when it is unreachable, and server errors are reported to an error-tracking service (with credentials and workspace content stripped — see the privacy policy’s subprocessor list) so we usually know about a problem before you do.',
