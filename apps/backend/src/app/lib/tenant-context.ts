 * S-1 (schema review 2026-07-06 §6): per-request tenant context for row-level
 * security.
 *
 * The tenant id for the current request/job is stored here and read by the
 * runtime pool's `onReserveConnection` hook (see base.repo.ts), which issues
 * `set_config('app.tenant_id', …)` on every connection checkout. Postgres RLS
 * policies (migration 2026-07-26) then scope every query to that tenant — a
 * defense-in-depth backstop *under* the app-level `.where('tenant_id', …)`
 * scoping, catching any query that forgets it (including the lint rule's
 * blind spots, e.g. chains broken across statements).
 *
 * When no tenant is set (pre-auth identify queries — login, refresh-token and
 * webhook/api-key resolution, public event pages — and the background-job
 * worker, some of whose jobs are intentionally cross-tenant), the GUC is left
 * empty and the RLS policy allows all rows, preserving today's behaviour.
