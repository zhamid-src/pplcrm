 * one place to exit demo mode. Demo mode is the pre-plan test drive — the
 * backend refuses to exit until the tenant has an active subscription, and it
 * blocks outward-facing configuration (senders, domains, mailbox sync,
 * newsletter sending, teammate invites) while the flag is set. Exiting deletes the seeded data
 * (the six draft forms, the built-in tags, and anything the user created are
 * kept) and refreshes the session so the shell banner disappears immediately.
