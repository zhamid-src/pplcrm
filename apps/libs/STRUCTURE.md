This file is a merged representation of a subset of the codebase, containing specifically included files and files not matching ignore patterns, combined into a single document by Repomix.

# File Summary

## Purpose
This file contains a packed representation of a subset of the repository's contents that is considered the most important context.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.

## File Format
The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Directory structure
4. Repository files (if enabled)
5. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  a. A header with the file path (## File: path/to/file)
  b. The full contents of the file in a code block

## Usage Guidelines
- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.

## Notes
- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules and Repomix's configuration
- Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including binary files
- Only files matching these patterns are included: libs/**/*, apps/**/*, scriptis/**/*, libs/common/src/**/*, libs/uxcommon/src/**/*
- Files matching these patterns are excluded: **/*.test.ts, **/*.spec.ts, **/dist/**, **/build/**, **/node_modules/**, **/.git/**, **/package-lock.json, **/yarn.lock, **/*.picture, **/*.png, **/*.jpg, **/*.jpeg, **/*.svg, **/*.ico, apps/**, **/STRUCTURE.md, **/*.spec.ts
- Files matching patterns in .gitignore are excluded
- Files matching default ignore patterns are excluded
- Files are sorted by Git change count (files with more changes are at the bottom)

/**
 * `pc-table` — the lightweight presentational table shell.
 *
 * The counterpart to the house `pc-datagrid`: where the datagrid owns data
 * fetching, sorting, filtering, selection and inline editing, `pc-table` owns
 * only the *chrome* — the bordered shell, the micro-caps header row, cell
 * density and the shared skeleton-loading idiom. It exists so bespoke tables
 * (Tags, Issues, Donations) stay visually identical to the datagrid without
 * inheriting its machinery. See the `pplcrm-table` skill.
 *
 * All visual styling comes from the shared, global `.pc-table-shell` / `.pc-table`
 * contract in `apps/frontend/src/styles.css` — the single source of truth both
 * this component and the datagrid consume. This component ships no styles of its
 * own (emulated encapsulation could not reach the projected rows anyway).
 *
 * Consumers keep full control of every cell and of the empty state (which is
 * per-entity by design — see design principles §3), projecting:
 *   - `[pcTableHead]` — the `<th>` cells for the header row
 *   - the default slot — the body rows *and* the page's own empty-state row,
 *     rendered only when not loading
 *   - `[pcTableFooter]` — optional caption/pagination hint rendered inside the
 *     shell, below the table (e.g. "Showing the latest 25 of 312")
 *
 * ```html
 * <pc-table [loading]="loading()" [columns]="5">
 *   <ng-container pcTableHead>
 *     <th>Tag</th><th>People</th><th>Last applied</th><th class="w-10"></th>
 *   </ng-container>
 *
 *   @if (rows().length === 0) {
 *     <tr><td colspan="5">…guided empty state…</td></tr>
 *   } @else {
 *     @for (row of rows(); track row.id) {
 *       <tr [class.animate-saved-flash]="highlightId() === row.id">…</tr>

/**
 * `pc-row-actions` — the house ⋯ overflow menu for a table row.
 *
 * The one idiom for per-row actions (design principles §4: destructive actions are
 * demoted to the ⋯ menu). Before this existed, five pages hand-rolled the same
 * DaisyUI dropdown and drifted apart on width, z-index, trigger element and border.
 *
 * It renders as a **popover-mode DaisyUI dropdown**: the menu carries the native
 * `popover` attribute, so an open menu is promoted to the browser's top layer and
 * placed against the trigger via CSS anchor positioning (`anchor-name` on the
 * button, `position-anchor` on the menu). This is what makes it usable inside a
 * table at all — `.pc-table-shell` sets `overflow-x: auto`, which per spec forces
 * `overflow-y: auto` too, so a normal absolutely-positioned `.dropdown-content` is
 * clipped by the shell's scroll box. No z-index can defeat ancestor clipping; only
 * leaving the shell's clipping context can, and the top layer does exactly that.
 *
 * Everything else — placement, open/close, Esc, light-dismiss, focus — is the
 * platform's (design §6, rung 1: DaisyUI + CSS, no JS positioning). The only
 * TypeScript here is the one bit of genuine state logic: closing the menu after an
 * action is chosen.
 *
 * Browsers without CSS anchor positioning (Safari < 26, Firefox < 144) fall back to
 * DaisyUI's own centered top-layer menu with a backdrop — unanchored, but never
 * clipped or truncated.
 *
 * Projected content is the menu body: `<li>` items, exactly as DaisyUI's `menu`
 * expects. Keep destructive items last and mark them `class="text-error"`.
 *
 * ```html
 * <td class="text-right">
 *   <pc-row-actions label="Route actions">
 *     <li><button type="button" (click)="openAssign(row)">Assign volunteer</button></li>
 *     <li><button type="button" class="text-error" (click)="deleteRoute(row)">Delete route</button></li>

/**
 * Subscription plans — the single source of truth for tiers, prices and limits.
 *
 * Consumed by:
 *  - backend enforcement  (modules/billing/usage-limits.ts, controller.ts, trpc.router.ts)
 *  - the CRM billing page (experiences/settings/billing)
 *  - the marketing website pricing page + home teaser
 *
 * Pricing model (decision log, 2026-07-14 — supersedes the flat-price 5-column model):
 *  - Three FEATURE tiers (Free / Grassroots / Movement). Which tier you're on is a feature
 *    decision. Within a tier, PRICE scales smoothly by emailable-subscriber bracket instead of
 *    stair-stepping between tiers — the old model jumped a customer 3.4× (Starter $29 →
 *    Representative $99) the moment they crossed one subscriber count. `representative` is
 *    retired. Feature split (revised 2026-07-14): newsletters are table stakes on EVERY plan
 *    including Free; forms, donations, automations, lists (segments) and volunteer management
 *    (teams & events) are the paid step-up (Grassroots and up); the field-ops surface — both
 *    companion apps (canvassing & deliveries), companion volunteer access & monitoring, yard
 *    signs, turf cutting, walk lists & routes, field reports, route optimization — is
 *    Movement-only.
 *  - Meter the EMAILABLE-SUBSCRIBER count, NOT total contacts. A campaign can store its
 *    whole voter / canvassing universe for free (storage is cheap) and only pays for who it
 *    can actually email. This is the differentiator vs. contact-metered tools.
 *  - Stripe never learns about "subscribers" — each purchasable tier has ONE graduated Stripe
 *    price, and the app reports `quantity = 1-based bracket index` (see `bracketIndexForSubscribers`).
 *    All bracket→price/subscriber-cap/email-cap logic lives here, in `plans.ts`, as inspectable
 *    data; Stripe just multiplies quantity by its graduated unit amounts.
 *  - Emails/month = 8× the bracket's subscriber cap on Grassroots (between Mailchimp
 *    Essentials' 10× and a weekly-send cadence) and 12× on Movement (matches Mailchimp
 *    Standard / Constant Contact Standard so the flagship spec-sheet line shows no smaller).
 *    Free keeps 2×. Enforced at send time since 2026-07-18 (send-guards.ts monthly allowance),
 *    not just alerted on.
 *  - Monthly send, storage and seat caps protect the real COGS: SendGrid (newsletters),
 *    Postmark (transactional, scales with seats/activity) and Azure Blob (files).
 *  - Companion volunteers carry an auth-SMS cost — and the companion apps that use them are
 *    Movement-only. (Revised 2026-07-16: companion volunteer access itself moved to
 *    Movement-only. On Grassroots it was a dead grant — volunteer links are minted only by
 *    turf assignments and delivery routes, both Movement-gated — so the old "15 volunteers"
 *    could never be used. Staff-side volunteer management — teams & volunteer events — stays
 *    Grassroots.)
 *  - Enterprise is dropped as a priced column (contact-us footnote only); the `enterprise`
 *    PlanKey stays valid internally for custom/negotiated tenants — `pricing: null` marks it.
 *  - All prices are USD.
 *  - Annual billing (added 2026-07-18): each purchasable tier also has a yearly Stripe price at
 *    exactly 10× the monthly unit amounts — "2 months free" (`ANNUAL_PRICE_MULTIPLIER`). The
 *    graduated ladder is linear in quantity, so 10× holds at every bracket and the whole
 *    quantity-as-bracket-index mechanism carries over unchanged. Display is the monthly
 *    equivalent rounded to the nearest dollar, with the EXACT annual total always alongside
 *    plus a rounding disclaimer ("$24 per month, billed annually as $290") — the checkable
 *    number is the annual total, which is what's actually charged. The website pricing page
 *    defaults to Annual (marketing convention: 2026-07-18); the in-app billing page keeps
 *    Monthly as its default (electoral campaigns end in November — don't nudge existing
 *    customers into prepay). Mid-year bracket GROWTH on an annual subscription is
 *    invoiced prorated immediately (see backend subscription-sync.ts); downgrades still defer
 *    to renewal on both intervals. Send/usage caps stay MONTHLY regardless of billing interval.
 *
 * Market calibration (competitive research 2026-07-14; final ladder locked 2026-07-15, monthly
 * billing): Grassroots beats every full-suite competitor at every count — $69 vs $75 (Mailchimp
 * Essentials) at 5k, $89 vs $110 at 10k, $129 vs $230 at 20k, $219 vs beehiiv Scale's $199 at
 * 50k is the one near-miss (beehiiv is newsletter-only). Movement beats Mailchimp Standard at
 * every count — $125 vs $100 at 5k is the exception early on, but $195 vs $230 at 15k,
 * $365 vs $450 at 50k, $565 vs $800 at 100k. Roughly 1.8× Grassroots at every bracket —
 * "cheapest full-featured option" rather than "suspiciously cheap".
 *
 * Stripe ops (manual, not code — one graduated recurring price per purchasable tier;
 * `quantity` = the bracket index from `bracketIndexForSubscribers`):
 *  - Grassroots: [{ up_to: 1, unit_amount: 2900 }, { up_to: 7, unit_amount: 2000 }, { up_to: 'inf', unit_amount: 7000 }]
 *    → qty 1 = $29, qty 2–7 add $20/step (→ $149), qty 8–10 add $70/step (→ $359; the
 *    piecewise step change at the 25,000-subscriber boundary — see GRASSROOTS_BRACKETS below).
 *  - Movement: [{ up_to: 1, unit_amount: 5500 }, { up_to: 7, unit_amount: 3500 }, { up_to: 'inf', unit_amount: 10000 }]
 *    → qty 1 = $55, qty 2–7 add $35/step (→ $265), qty 8–11 add $100/step (→ $665; same
 *    piecewise step change at the 25,000-subscriber boundary — see MOVEMENT_BRACKETS below).
 *  - Grassroots annual (interval = year): [{ up_to: 1, unit_amount: 29000 }, { up_to: 7, unit_amount: 20000 }, { up_to: 'inf', unit_amount: 70000 }]
 *  - Movement annual (interval = year): [{ up_to: 1, unit_amount: 55000 }, { up_to: 7, unit_amount: 35000 }, { up_to: 'inf', unit_amount: 100000 }]
 *    (exactly 10× the monthly unit amounts. Same graduated shape, same quantity semantics,
 *    exclusive tax on the price. Created 2026-07-18 in BOTH modes — test-mode IDs are set in
 *    .env.production, live-mode IDs are in its comments for the launch swap. A default billing
 *    portal configuration with subscription_update enabled (price switches only, proration
 *    always_invoice) exists in test mode so monthly customers can self-switch to annual; the
 *    live-mode portal needs the same configuration at launch alongside the sk_live swap.)
 *
 * Internal plan keys are persisted in `tenants.subscription_plan` and mapped to Stripe
 * price IDs. Display names are intentionally allowed to differ from keys, but here they are
 * kept aligned (`grassroots`→"Grassroots", `movement`→"Movement", …) except the free key,
 * which presents as "Free" (renamed from "Starter" in the 2026-07-14 overhaul —
 * `LEGACY_PLAN_ALIASES` resolves stale `starter` values written before the rename).
